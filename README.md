# Image-Quality-Assessment
I developed a machine learning solution to optimize digital storage by identifying and recommending the best quality images among similar ones. Using ResNet-50 with transfer learning, it evaluates resolution, sharpness, and noise, achieving 82% accuracy. A Streamlit-powered frontend ensures efficient storage and energy conservation.

Features
-Image Quality Analysis: Evaluates images based on resolution, sharpness, and noise levels using a ResNet-50 model with transfer learning.
-Recommendations: Identifies the best-quality image and suggests redundant ones for deletion.
-Interactive Frontend: A Streamlit-powered interface for easy image upload and visualization.
-Robust Backend: Machine learning model hosted with support for scalability and efficient processing.
