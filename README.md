# Image-Quality-Assessment
I developed a machine learning solution to optimize digital storage by identifying and recommending the best quality images among similar ones. Using ResNet-50 with transfer learning, it evaluates resolution, sharpness, and noise, achieving 82% accuracy. A Streamlit-powered frontend ensures efficient storage and energy conservation.
